# HTTP Server

HTTP uses TCP.

To create a server that works with HTTP, we just create a TCP server.

To configure our code to handle request/response in an HTTP fashion which works with browsers, we need to adhere to HTTP standards.

## HTTP/1.1 message

An HTTP message is made up of the following:

- a request/status line
- zero or more header fields
- an empty line indicating the end of the header section
- an optional message body.
